    "\n",
    "Sometimes ** map() ** returns nested lists, to flattern these nested lists we can use ** flatMap() **. So, ** flatMap() ** is called individually for each element in our input RDD. Instead of returning a single element, we return an iterator with our return values. Rather than producing an RDD of iterators, we get back an RDD that consists of the elements from all of the iterators.\n",

    "* **RDD.intersection(other)**  returns only elements in both RDDs. intersection() also removes all duplicates (including duplicates from a single RDD) while running. While intersection() and union() are two similar concepts, the performance of intersection() is much worse since it requires a shuffle over the network to identify common elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ** RDD.subtract(other)** function takes in another RDD and returns an RDD that has only values present in the first RDD and not the second RDD. Like intersection(), it performs a shuffle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ** RDD.cartesian(other) ** transformation returns all possible pairs of (a,b) where a is in the source RDD and b is in the other RDD. The Cartesian product can be useful when we wish to consider the similarity between all possible pairs, such as computing every user’s expected interest in each offer. We can also take the Cartesian product of an RDD with itself, which can be useful for tasks like user similarity. Be warned, however, that the Cartesian product is very expensive for large RDDs.\n",

    "As a simple example, consider an application that keeps a large table of user information in memory—say, an RDD of (UserID, UserInfo) pairs, where UserInfo contains a list of topics the user is subscribed to. The application periodically combines this table with a smaller file representing events that happened in the past five minutes—say, a table of (UserID, LinkInfo) pairs for users who have clicked a link on a website in those five minutes. For example, we may wish to count how many users visited a link that was not to one of their subscribed topics. We can perform this combination with Spark’s join() operation, which can be used to group the User Info and LinkInfo pairs for each UserID by key.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will run fine as is, but it will be inefficient. This is because the join() operation, called each time processNewLogs() is invoked, does not know anything about how the keys are partitioned in the datasets. By default, this operation will hash all  the keys of both datasets, sending elements with the same key hash across the network\n",
    "to the same machine, and then join together the elements with the same key on that machine (see Figure 4-4). Because we expect the userData table to be much larger than the small log of events seen every five minutes, this wastes a lot of work: the userData table is hashed and shuffled across the network on every call, even though it doesn’t change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixing this is simple: just use the partitionBy() transformation on userData to hash-partition it at the start of the program. We do this by passing a spark.HashPartitioner object to partitionBy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processNewLogs() method can remain unchanged: the events RDD is local to processNewLogs(), and is used only once within this method, so there is no advantage in specifying a partitioner for events. Because we called partitionBy() when building userData, Spark will now know that it is hash-partitioned, and calls to join() on it will take advantage of this information. In particular, when we call user Data.join(events), Spark will shuffle only the events RDD, sending events with each particular UserID to the machine that contains the corresponding hash partition of userData (see Figure 4-5). The result is that a lot less data is communicated over the network, and the program runs significantly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that partitionBy() is a transformation, so it always returns a new RDD—it does not change the original RDD in place. RDDs can never be modified once created. Therefore it is important to persist and save as userData the result of partitionBy(), not the original sequenceFile(). Also, the 100 passed to partitionBy() represents the number of partitions, which will control how many parallel tasks perform further operations on the RDD (e.g., joins); in general, make this at least as large as the number of cores in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many other Spark operations automatically result in an RDD with known partitioning information, and many operations other than join() will take advantage of this information. For example, sortByKey() and groupByKey() will result in range-partitioned and hash-partitioned RDDs, respectively. On the other hand, operations like map() cause the new RDD to forget the parent’s partitioning information, because such operations could theoretically modify the key of each record. The next few sections describe how to determine how an RDD is partitioned, and exactly how\n",
    "partitioning affects the various Spark operations."
